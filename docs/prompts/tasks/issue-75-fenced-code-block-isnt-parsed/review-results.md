# Review Results — Issue #75: Fenced Code Block Isn't Parsed

## Tool Output

### `npm run lint`

```
> vue-boilerplate-jli@0.0.0 lint
> eslint . --fix

Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.39.2

SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'
    at compileSourceTextModule (node:internal/modules/esm/utils:318:16)
    ...
```

**Pre-existing failure** — identical error reproduced on the `develop` worktree before this branch was created. Not caused by the changes in this fix.

### `npm run type-check`

```
> vue-boilerplate-jli@0.0.0 type-check
> vue-tsc --build
```

No output — zero type errors. ✓

## Security Guidelines Checklist

| # | Rule | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | DOMPurify allowlist covers `<pre>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>` | ✓ ADR-007 confirms default config retains all three; no custom `ALLOWED_TAGS` needed |
| 2 | `outerHTML` reaches `v-html` only through DOMPurify | ✓ Pipeline unchanged; extractor returns raw string, generators concatenate it, components sanitize via `computed(() => DOMPurify.sanitize(...))` |
| 3 | Clipboard uses sanitized value | ✓ Not touched by this change; `PlatformMedium.vue` and `PlatformSubstack.vue` already use `sanitizedBodyHtml` |
| 4 | Netlify Function domain allowlist not relaxed | ✓ Not touched |
| 5 | Client-side URL validation before dispatch | ✓ Not touched |
| 6 | No new external dependencies | ✓ Only `Element.tagName` and `Element.outerHTML` DOM built-ins used |
| 7 | Test fixtures must not contain executable content | ✓ Not applicable to source files; tester agent responsible |
| 8 | `outerHTML` not re-serialised or decoded | ✓ String treated as opaque throughout; concatenated with `join('')` only |

## Business Spec Checklist

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| `<pre>` collected before first `<h2>` | ✓ `INTRODUCTION_ELEMENT_TAGS` includes `'PRE'` |
| `<ul>` collected before first `<h2>` | ✓ `INTRODUCTION_ELEMENT_TAGS` includes `'UL'` |
| `<blockquote>` collected before first `<h2>` | ✓ `INTRODUCTION_ELEMENT_TAGS` includes `'BLOCKQUOTE'` |
| Source order preserved | ✓ Sibling traversal in DOM order; `push` appends in encounter order |
| Elements after `<h2>` excluded | ✓ Loop exits when `current === firstH2` |
| `<div>`, `<table>`, `<ol>` not included | ✓ Set is an explicit allowlist; unlisted tags are skipped |
| `<p>`-only introduction unchanged | ✓ `'P'` remains in the set; existing behaviour preserved |
| `<pre>`-only introduction does not trigger `missing-introduction` | ✓ Returns non-empty string; empty string only when nothing is collected |
| `null` return when no `<h2>` present | ✓ Guard on line 97 unchanged |
| X and LinkedIn unaffected | ✓ No changes to `xContentGenerator.ts` or `linkedInContentGenerator.ts` |
| FR-2 docs updated | ✓ `docs/specs/01-requirements.md` updated |
| CLAUDE.md selector docs updated | ✓ Introduction bullet updated |

## Object Calisthenics

| Rule | Status |
|---|---|
| 1. One level of indentation | ✓ `while` body delegates condition to `isIntroductionElement`; inner push is one expression |
| 2. No else | ✓ All paths use early return |
| 3. Wrap primitives | Documented exception — tag names as plain `string` in a `Set` is the idiomatic pattern |
| 4. First-class collections | ✓ `INTRODUCTION_ELEMENT_TAGS` is a `Set`; `collected` array is encapsulated in helper |
| 5. One dot per line | Exception consistent with existing codebase style (`collected.push(current.outerHTML)` mirrors original `introParagraphs.push(currentElement.outerHTML)`) |
| 6. No abbreviations | ✓ All identifiers fully spelled out |
| 7. Entities ≤ 5 lines | ✓ All three new functions are ≤ 5 lines |
| 8. No class > 2 instance variables | N/A — no classes |
| 9. No getters/setters | N/A — no classes |

## Summary

The implementation is correct, minimal, and consistent with the existing codebase conventions. Type-check passes. The lint failure is pre-existing and unrelated to this change. All security rules are addressed. All business requirements are met. No scope creep.
